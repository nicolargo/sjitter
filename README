Sjitter provides, in a simple command line interface, 
a tool to measure jitter, one way delay and bandwidth.

Sjitter is a simple network performance tool to measure:
- jitter (based on the RFC 1889).
- one way delay (based on UDP datagram transit time).
- bandwidth (steel experimental).
Sjitter is a client/server program. Both client and server 
need to be date and time synchronize.
